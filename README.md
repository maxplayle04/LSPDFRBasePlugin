# LSPDFRBasePlugin
This is a starter-friendly repository that allows you to create your own LSPDFR plugins with only basic C# knowledge. The bulk of starting out has already been done for you, with thanks to developers with experience regarding the RAGENativeUI/RAGEPluginHook/LSPDFR APIs.

## Contribution
If you're a semi-experienced developer, and believe you have something to add to the plugin - please do feel free to get involved and submit a PR with some changes. Whilst I visit GitHub fairly often, please let me know on another service
such as Discord if you're going to submit changes, so I can get online and take a look at this repository.
